We'll be using "git" to keep track of changes to our ".c" files. 


Windows: 

Download "git" and install it somewhere. For instance, you install it in "C:/Program Files/git/" or "C:/Program Files (x86)/git/" or something. Just remember where it is. And then check to see that you can access it on the Command Prompt. Open Command Prompt and paste the whole path to "git.exe". 

This might be "C:/Program Files/git/bin/git.exe" or "C:/Program Files (x86)/git/bin/git.exe". I'm really not sure where it is, so you'll need to find and try this on your own machine. So it might look like: 

C:/Users/myname/Desktop> 
C:/Users/myname/Desktop> "C:/Program Files/git/bin/git.exe" /help 

If it works, cool. If it doesn't, then the path you've used is incorrect, or it contains spaces and you didn't use the double-quote mark ("). 


Linux: 

"git" might already be available on your computer; it came with mine. If not, open Terminal and "sudo apt-get git" to install it. 





Make sure that you can always easily call "git" as "git" on the command line. In Windows, you can do this by: 

Open "Control Panel" 
> Choose "System and Security" 
> Choose "System" 
> Click "Advanced system settings" 
> Click "Environment Variables" 
> In "System Variables", find the "PATH" variable 
> Click "Edit..." 
> Put in a semi-colon (;) 
> Add the folder which has "git.exe" 

This might be "C:/Program Files/git/bin" or "C:/Program Files (x86)/git/bin/". I'm not really sure, but you'd know... 

> Click "OK", "OK", "OK" 
> Now, test on the command line that it works. 

C:/Users/myname/Desktop> 
C:/Users/myname/Desktop> git.exe /help 

Maybe even try this: 

C:/Users/myname/Desktop> git /help 





Now, we'll do some work. You'll need to make a copy of the assignment code somewhere. Change the present working directory. Examples: 

Windows: "cd %USERPROFILE%/Desktop/path/to/code/" 
Linux: "cd ~/path/to/code/" 





Then put this into your command line: 

git clone "https://github.com/lloctan/our-card-code-base.git" 





You'll find a copy of the contents in this folder "our-card-code-base/". Please keep the name of this folder the way it is. I have no idea what will happen when you try to change it. 

Anyway, now that you have copies of this stuff, you need to tell "git" about it. Put the following commands into your command line. 

;; This changes the present working directory to "our-card-code-base/" 
cd "our-card-code-base/" 

;; This tells "git" that this is your work folder 
git init 

;; This tells "git" to include every file in your work folder 
git add . 





Now, make a new Github account at "https://github.com/join". You'll need this so that you can update our code-base. 

Once you create and verify an account, let me know what your account name is and I'll make you a "collaborator" to the code-base. 





Here are two visual guides to how "git" works:

Suppose some time tomorrow you want to do some programming. Before you start work, you need to see whether or not you have the most current version of the code. 

git pull
